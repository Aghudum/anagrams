# Anagramator
Anagramator is a Node.js application that lists out sets of anagrams from a text file containing words. The text file must contain a word per line.
Anagramator is case sensitive and treats every character equally e.g apostrophes are treated the same way as alphabets.

I have sacrificed a bit of performance for a more SOLID code.
